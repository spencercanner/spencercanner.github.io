                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h3>I am an Industrial Engineering Student at the University of Toronto. I am very hardworking with a passionate
                attitude towards everything I create. Every project I take on, big or small, is crafted with a strong attention to detail
                and I am always proud of the finished product. I am a quick and avid learner, interested in absorbing as much knowledge
                as possible.</h3>
                <h3>I am very focused on technology, as it is an extremely powerful tool. It's ability to have such a substantial impact on
                society drives me to dive deeper into this field. Specifically, areas such as UI and UX are of great interest to me as they
                deal with how people use technology, and consequently the extent to which it has an effect in their lives. Moving forward
                I would like to create immersive tech incorporating the arts to improve the lives of others. Additionally web design is also
                a major interest of mine as the internet has become our main source of information, and I believe it should act as a seamless
                bridge to this information rather than a roadblock.</h3>
                <h3>Outside of academics and tech, I am also very interested in music. Having grown up in an environment with an abundance of musical
                instruments, and pursuing my high school education at an arts school, music has become an essential part of my life. I currently listen
                to music at every possible occasion, and enjoy playing the guitar in my free time. I believe that my history with music has lead me
                to become a more creative person, and consequently has given me a unique outlook on problem solving. This has proven to be useful
                in tackling many problems faced throughout my academic career, as well as in engineering.</h3>
